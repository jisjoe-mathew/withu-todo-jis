# withu_todo

A WithU Test Project

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for the WithU test. Please complete the following tasks

- Clone the project locally. You will then upload this to your personal GitHub and send me the link so i can review
- Implement Provider as the apps state management
- Implement a realtime listener on the Firstore database. Please rename your collection to something unique like your name. Head to lib -> non_ui -> firebase_manager and replace the tasksRef collection
- This listener should update a Provider model which in turn updates the UI. Therefore you should be able to complete a task on the 'Tasks' page and it appears on the 'Completed Tasks' page
- Add any additional functionality / cleanup you think would improve the app (bonus points)

### PLEASE NOTE
- Please run on an iOS simulator as i have only added an iOS Firebase  project
